### Release notes

#### v2.1

* Moved `LCSCR`, `QK_BOOT` to reduce occasional press
* Reorganized positions of `TO(_NUM)`, `TO(_NAV)` and `TO(_NAV)` at `_CTR` layer
* Returned `LTR_EN` and `LTR_UA` back to thumbs (what I was thinking?)
* Totally restructured `_SPC` layer using another symbols grouping method (I hope it will be more convenient and intuitive this time)
